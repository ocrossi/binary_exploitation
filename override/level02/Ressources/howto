ok we cant make it overflow for 1 thing

then there is a strcspn that will use offset of the user name to put 0x0 somewhere on stack
maybe we can play with this

ok upon further reading we should not see the string coz we wouldnt have rights to do this, but dirtycow

But there seems to be a format string vuln on the last printf of main, which could be used to rewrite
exit got table entry to redirect code exec at line 625 and hit win cond

somehow doesnt work, lets check if i take control of good param

ok looks like there is some kind of trick for this format string vuln, 
i can control 27th param but not the 28th, wtf?? + cant expose stack forever coz limitation on the
size of fgets to 100chars, cf asm

should not be a problem tho
we should put address got exit + padd x0601228 - 4 pr got +

we have prob segfault in gdb doesnt finish printf.
Lets try one more time.

Ok cant use format string vuln, i dont know why

lets try sth else
