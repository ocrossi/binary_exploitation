we have main, calls test function with a radom seed
then goes to test, calls a bunch of decrypt functions

decrypt call to bin/sh, our win cond, np idea whatsoever for tis lv


start with a srand(time(0))

approach to this was finding a good unix timestamp to match the cond
(0x1337d00d - rand()) = 18

for now the problem is there is to much values to test

next possibilities would be:
- multi thread
- MORE POWER + remove printf in loop to gain time
