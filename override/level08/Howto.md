can use format string on file input

idea is to put shellcode in av[2], use av[1] to redirect
to where av[2] is stored on stack

ok finally this was wy simpler
just have to create /tmp/backups/home/users/level09

then run ~/level08 ~level09/.pass in tmp

the program reads flag for us and stores it in a directory where we have the right to create other subdirs
