## Exploit type: Format string exploit to modify variable value

kindof the same thing as previous level, except there is a restriction in fgets,
we cant print more than 512 chars. We can use a trick of printf format type to print
characters with printf without typing them all into standard input

BUT, we can do an other quite neat trick to avoir printing 0x1025544 chars,
what we can do is to try do two writes with printf with writing 2 upper bytes
and 2 lower bytes of the required variable.

in gdb r < /FULLPATHFILE
break in printf p then check memory area around location m (m and next word)
so the 1st print is for 2 lower bytes 0x5544 so 8 chars for 2 adresses + 21820 padding + 12%n to write in m adress
2nd one we want x10102 so  65794 chars, we already printed 12828, 43966 to go, but at adddress m+2
and 13$n cause we control from the 12th param to n paramsto write a bit further
