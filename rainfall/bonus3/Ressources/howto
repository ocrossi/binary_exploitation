we have a problem with gdb
the fact that program exits if fopen doesnt work protects us from
using gdb (with user rights bonus3) to open this file

neat trick : create file 65 chars long to simulate pass 
python -c "print 'a' * 66" > file
then in gdb change filename of fopen to this new file like so
(gdb) set {char [23]}0x080486f2="/home/user/bonus3/file"

now we can go to atoi and strcmp to see whats up
so we atoi argv[1]

we can see that we use atoi as an offset to store 0 on stack at adress esp+eax(result atoi)+0x18
and then we strcmp whats at stack esp+0x18 with something empty, so if we get 1st arg to be empty we pass the strcmp
and then pass the levl with the call to /bin/sh
