## Exploit type : use after free

we have a program with 4 ifs where we can enter commands in standard input
"auth " !! space at the end important
"login"
"service"
"reset"

auth and service are 2 global variablse that we will assign to a place on heap
0x804a008
and 0x804a018

there is a condition with a call to system, our win cond. to go there we have to write something
at address auth+32 = 0x804a028

then we can see that the service command at each iteration changes of 16 bytes, so 0x10

if we check in gdb the strdup puts a \n in the value pointed by service, which is the strcpy in the auth cond
and strdup increments service at each loop iteration because some memory is written

so 
./level8
auth
service
service
login

and we good
